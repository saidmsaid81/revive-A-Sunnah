<p><strong>Q 1: Should the intention to observe Sawm (Fast) in Ramadan be made at night, or is it permissible to make it during the daytime? To give an example, if someone is informed at forenoon that today is Ramadan, should they make up for the Sawm of that day later?</strong></p>

<p> It is obligatory to make the intention to fast on any day of Ramadan in the preceding night before dawn. Thus, starting the Sawm in the daytime without making the intention in the preceding night does not discharge the obligation. Accordingly, if someone knows at forenoon that today is a Ramadan day and then makes the intention to fast, it is obligatory on them to abstain from all invalidators of Sawm until sunset. They also have to make up for the Sawm of that day later. This is based on the Hadith related by Ibn `Umar on the authority of Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Anyone who has not made the intention to fast before Fajr no Sawm counts for them.
	</p>
	<footer>(Related by Imam Ahmad, the Compilers of the Sunan [Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa’y and Ibn Majah], Ibn Khuzaymah, and Ibn Hibban.</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter two Imams judged it to be authentically transmitted in the Marfu` [a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with a connected or disconnected chain of narration] form.) This ruling applies to the obligatory Sawm. As for voluntary Sawm, it is permissible to make the intention to fast at daytime, if no eating, drinking or sexual intercourse has taken place since dawn. This is because it is authentically reported on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to her one day at forenoon and said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Do you have anything (any food)?" She said: "No." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Then I am fasting. 
	</p>
	<footer>(Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Book of Authentic Hadith].)</footer>

<p><strong>Q: What is the opinion of the Fuqaha’ (Muslim jurists) and scholars of religion on Tarawih (special supererogatory night Prayer in Ramadan)? Is it twenty or eight Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer) - according to the Sunnah? If the Sunnah is to offer it as eight Rak‘ahs, why is it offered as twenty Rak‘ahs in Al-Masjid Al-Nabawy (the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah)? Most people conclude from that it is the Sunnah to offer it as twenty Rak‘ahs.</strong></p>

<p>A: Tarawih is a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) initiated by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). There are proofs that he (peace be upon him) never offered more than eleven Rak‘ahs, whether in Ramadan or at any other time.</p>

<p>Abu Salamah asked `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to offer supererogatory Salah (Prayer) in Ramadan. She said,</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not pray more than eleven Rak’ahs in Ramadan or at any other time. He would pray four Rak‘ahs, and do not ask about their beauty and length, then he would pray four Rak‘ahs, and do not ask about their beauty and length, then he would pray three Rak‘ahs.' `Aishah added, 'I asked: O Messenger of Allah! Will you sleep before offering the Witr (Prayer with an odd number of units)?' He said, 'O `Aishah! My eyes sleep but my heart does not.' 
	</p>
	<footer>(Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to offer thirteen Rak‘ahs on some nights. Thus, the words of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) when she said that The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not pray more than eleven Rak’ahs in Ramadan or at any other time should be interpreted according to the more frequent practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in order to reconcile between the Hadiths.  </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong in offering more than this, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not set a specific limit for optional Night Prayer. When he was asked about it, he (peace be upon him) stated:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>(Optional) Night Salah is two Rak‘ahs followed by two Rak‘ahs (and so on), and when one of you fears the break of dawn (Fajr Prayer), let them offer a single Rak‘ah to make the Salah they have offered Witr (Prayer with an odd number of units).</p>
	<footer> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>He (peace be upon him) did not set a limit, whether eleven Rak‘ahs or anything else, which indicates the flexibility in optional Night Prayer, whether in Ramadan or at any other time.</p>

<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on the blood that comes out of a woman outside the menstrual or post-partum period? Should she make up later for the days in which she experiences such blood during the daytime of Ramadan?</strong></p>

<p>All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>

<p>If the blood referred to above comes out of her during the daytime in Ramadan and it is not menstrual blood or postpartum blood, she is obliged to observe Sawm (Fasting) and Salah (Prayer). She must not stop observing Sawm or Salah, and she does not need to make up later for the days in which she observed Sawm and Salah while having Istihadah (abnormal vaginal bleeding outside the menstrual or post-partum period).</p>

If Du‘a’-ul-Qunut is permissible once or twice during Ramadan, please explain this to the Ummah (nation based on one creed) to be made clear in every Masjid no matter big or small.</strong></p>

<p> Du‘a’-ul-Qunut in Witr (Prayer with an odd number of units) is Mustahab (desirable) because of the Hadith reported by Al-Hasan ibn ‘Aly (may Allah be pleased with them) who said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) taught me some words to say during Qunut in the Witr Prayer. They are, 'Allahumma ihdini fiman hadayta, wa ‘afini fiman ‘afayta, wa tawallani fiman tawallayta, wa barik li fima a‘tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta, fa inaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alaik, wa inahu la yadhilu man walayta, tabarakta Rabana wa ta‘alayta [O Allah! Guide me among those You have guided. Protect me among those You have protected. Take me into Your Care among those You have taken into Your Care. Bless me in what You have bestowed (on me). Guard me from the evil of what You have decreed, for You are the One Who decrees, and none can decree over You. Truly, the one whom You patronize can never be abased. Blessed and Exalted are You, our Lord].'

	<footer> (Related by Ahl-ul-Sunan [authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes: Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa’y])</footer>

<p>It is permissible for the Muslim to say this Du‘a’ sometimes and leave it at other times, whether during Ramadan or in any other month.</p>

<p><strong>Q : The month of Ramadan has come and it is time to offer Tarawih (special supererogatory night Prayer in Ramadan), is it better to go and attend it in the Masjid (Mosque) or offer it at home?I am not an Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer), but a Ma’mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer). I love to recite the Qur’an and prefer reciting to listening. Is there any sin if I pray Tarawih at home?
</strong></p>

<p>A: There is no sin on you if you offer Tarawih at home, because it is a Nafilah (supererogatory prayer). However, it is better to pray it with the Imam in the Masjid following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them). When the Prophet (peace be upon him) led his Sahabah in Tarawih on some nights until the end of the first third of the night, one of them said to him: We wish that you would lead us in Nafilah Prayer for the rest of the night. He (peace be upon him) replied: </p>

<p><strong>Q 1: What is the ruling on a 15-year-old youth who breaks his Sawm (Fast) during Ramadan, under the excuse that he is very tired and cannot complete his Sawm on that day? If he is required to make up for that day, can he make up for it after yet another Ramadan passes?</strong></p>

<p>A: It is prohibited for a Mukallaf (person meeting the conditions to be held legally accountable for their actions) - someone who is a sane, adult, healthy, resident (non-traveling) Muslim - to break their Sawm during the daytime in Ramadan. If they experience hardship and are forced by to break their Sawm, exactly as someone who is forced by necessity to eat dead meat, they may only eat as much as is needed to remove the hardship. Then they have to abstain from all that breaks Sawm (Fast) for the rest of the day, and make up for that day after Ramadan. If they delay making up for it until the following Ramadan with no legitimate excuse, then they have to make up for that day and also feed a needy person for every day not fasted. Anyone who has fully attained fifteen years of age is an adult person. The same is true for a boy who discharges Maniy (sperm) out of desire in wet dreams or the like or has coarse hair around his pubic region. A girl has an additional fourth sign of puberty, which is menstruation.</p>

<p><strong>What is the ruling on having injections during the daytime in Ramadan, whether for the purpose of nutrition or treatment?</strong></p>

<p> It is permissible for a person who is observing Sawm (Fast) to be treated by injections, whether intravenous or intramuscular, during the day in Ramadan. But it is impermissible to have nutritive injections, as they come under the same ruling as having food and drinks.Thus, it is considered a trick to break Sawm in Ramadan. If it is possible to have the intravenous or intramuscular injections during the night, it will be better.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Some patients - may Allah cure them - suffer from renal failure, so they need to go through kidney dialysis (wash), which is an artificial kidney usedto purify the blood from waste products two or three times a week. All the patient’s blood is passed through this artificial kidney, cleansed, and then returned to the body. Some purifying substances are added to the blood inside the artificial kidney; otherwise the patient’s life will be endangered because of the renal dysfunction.
The question is whether this process invalidates Sawm (Fasting), given that it is a necessity. It is so hard for the patients to break their Sawm and make up for it later, while their bodies gain nothing except having the blood cleaned from impurities. This is a question asked by many people. Please advise concerning this, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>

<p>A: His Eminence the Manager of King Faysal Hospital and His Eminence the Manager of the Military Hospital in Riyadh were addressed by letters no. 1756/2 dated 14/8/1406 and 1757/2 dated 4/8/1406 respectively to inquire about the nature of the process of kidney dialysis, whether it involves mixing chemicals, and whether it includes nutrients.</p>

<p>They replied with letters no. 5693 dated 27/8/1406 and 10/16/7807 dated 19/8/1406 respectively clarifying that kidney dialysis is transfusion of the patient’s blood to a machine (an artificial kidney) which purifies it and then returns it to the body. Some chemicals and nutrients are added to the blood, such as carbohydrates, saltsand others.</p>

<p>Having studied the issue in question and understood the nature of kidney dialysis with the help of experts, the Committee gave a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) that the mentioned kidney dialysis invalidates Sawm.</p>

<p>A: If the distance they travel is equal to the distance over which it is permissible to shorten Salah (Prayers), then they are permitted to break their Sawm during their journey. They must make up for the days of Sawm that they miss before the start of the following month of Ramadan. This is based on the general rule in the Words of Allah (Exalted be He):</p>

However, if the amount of blood taken from him is customarily considered a large amount, then he should make up for that day to avoid an area of scholarly disagreement and to be on the safe side through discharging one’s responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I suffered from a serious disease in the last ten days of Ramadan, 1395 A.H. I broke the Sawm (Fast) for four days in this blessed month because of my sickness. I hoped that I could make up for these days when I restore my health, but I am still ill up to now and the coming Ramadan is about to start. I am unable to make up for these days and to fast the next Ramadan. Additionally, I am not sure that I will restore my health later. Would you please tell in writing what I should do and the cash value of feeding at present? If there are a few poor persons in our village, shall I repeat paying this value to these poor people?</strong></p>

<p>
	A: If the case is as you have mentioned, you have to be patient until Allah cures you of your illness.You then can make up for the days you missed in the months of Ramadan. The basic rule in this respect is the Saying of Allah (Exalted be He):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Saum (fasts) must be made up] from other days.</p>
<footer>Surah Al-Baqarah 2:185</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Your uncertainty of recovery cannot be a basis for deciding that your healing is hopeless or set you free from liability for making up and permit you to the act of feeding the poor for the missed fasts. Rather, you should think good of Allah and hope for recovery while getting ready for the Hereafter. May Allah cure you of every disease and help you perform the obligations. When the doctors decide that your sickness which render you unable to fast is incurable, then you should feed one poor person for every day (past or coming) missed of Ramadan half a Sa‘ (1 Sa‘ = 2.172 kg) of the local staple food, dates or something else. If you give a poor person dinner or lunch for the number of days that you did not fast, that will be sufficient. As to paying in cash, it does not discharge the obligation.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I used to masturbate during the daytime in Ramadan when I was fourteen and fifteen years old. I do not remember how many days I did that. At that time I was not aware that this is Haram (prohibited); whether in Ramadan or at any other time. I even did not realize that this is what is known as the secret habit (masturbation). I would then perform Wudu’ (ablution) and offer Salah (Prayer) without Ghusl (full ritual bath) following major ritual impurity. What is the religious ruling on my Salah and Sawm (Fasting)? Do I have to repeat them, taking into consideration that I do not know how many days that I committed this act? What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>A: First, practicing masturbation is Haram (prohibited) and it is even more sinful during the day in Ramadan. Second, it is obligatory to make up for the days on which you broke your Sawm because masturbation invalidates Sawm. You should try to estimate how many days this occurred. Third, it is also obligatory to pay Kaffarah (expiation) which is giving a needy person half a Sa‘ (1 Sa‘ = 2.172 kg) of wheat and the like of the staple food of your area for each day that you missed if you delay making up for it until the next Ramadan arrives.Fourth, it is obligatory to take Ghusl after masturbation and it is insufficient to perform Wudu’ (ablution) if you have experienced ejaculation. Fifth, it is compulsory to make up for the Salahs which you offered without taking Ghusl, because minor ritual purification (Wudu’ and the like) does not suffice in place of major ritual purification (Ghusl).</p>

<p><strong>Is it permissible to wash the body with water and soap during the day of Ramadan? Does having a wet dream invalidate Sawm (Fast)? Also, does applying perfume invalidate Sawm?</strong></p>


<p>A: Firstly: It is permissible for the fasting person to wash their body during the day of Ramadan with water and soap. Secondly: If someone has a wet dream during the day of Ramadan while fasting, this does not invalidate their Sawm; but they should perform Ghusl (ritual bath following major ritual impurity) if Maniy (sperm/vaginal secretions) is ejaculated. Thirdly: Sawm is not invalidated by applying any kind of perfume during the day of Ramadan while fasting, but one should not inhale incenseor powdered perfumes such as musk.</p>

<p><strong>Q: On the 14th of Ramadan, it happened that I was lying on my bed after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer and my wife came and stretched out beside me. She started caressing me until we ended up having conjugal intercourse.On a previous day also during Ramadan we had engaged in foreplay until I ejaculated. What is the ruling on a man having sexual intercourse with his wife or ejaculating during the daytime in Ramadan? What is the ruling on kissing and engaging in foreplay?</strong>
</p>

<p>A: First: If the reality is as you mentioned, and you intentionally had sexual intercourse with your wife during the daytime in Ramadan while you were observing Sawm (Fasting), both of you have to make up for that day and perform Kaffarah (expiation). The Kaffarah is to free a believing slave, and if this is not possible, you have to observe Sawm for two successive months; any one of you who cannot observe Sawm must feed sixty poor people thirty Sa‘s (1 Sa‘ = 2.172 kg) of wheat, dates, rice, or foodstuffs similar to that which you provide for your own family; giving each poor person half a Sa‘. Second: If the reality is as you mentioned and you engaged in foreplay with your wife during the daytime of Ramadan while fasting until you ejaculated, you also have to make up for that day. Your wife also has to make up for the day if she experienced ejaculation without having conjugal intercourse. Third: It is permissible for someone who is fasting to kiss their spouse if they are confident they will not ejaculate. However, it is Makruh (reprehensible) if ejaculation is feared. Anyone who kisses or engages in foreplay with their spouse while observing Sawm and ejaculates, their Sawm will be spoiled, according to the soundest opinion of scholars. They have to make up for the day, but they do not have to perform Kaffarah.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I was pregnant during the blessed month of Ramadan. I had a vaginal bleeding on Ramadan 20th, but I neither ate nor drank, i.e., I kept fasting. During my stay in the hospital I broke my Sawm (Fast) for four days. After Ramadan I made up for the days of Sawm I missed. Should I make up for them again, bearing in mind that I have not given birth yet? Please advise me, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>

<p>A: Your observing Sawm while having vaginal bleeding during pregnancy has no effect on the validity of your Sawm, just like the case of Istihadah (abnormal vaginal bleeding outside the menstrual or post-partum period). Therefore, your Sawm is valid. Moreover, your making up for the four days you missed during your stay in hospital after Ramadan discharges the obligation, and you do not have to fast them again.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does performing ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) during the months of Hajj have any particular virtue different from performing it in other months? </strong></p>

<p>A: The best month to perform ‘Umrah is during Ramadan, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </p> 

<blockquote>
<p>‘Umrah (performed) in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward).</p> 
<footer>(Agreed upon its authenticity by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</footer> 
</blockquote>

<p>According to another narration by Al-Bukhari:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>It is equivalent to performing Hajj with me.   </p>
	<footer>Narrated by Bukhari,Book on Hajj,Chapter on Hajj for women,no.1863</footer>

<p>According to the narration by Muslim:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>It is equivalent to Hajj or Hajj performed with me (in reward). </p>
	<footer>Narrated by Muslim, Book on Hajj, Chapter on excellence of performing `Umrah in Ramadan, no. 1256.</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that it is equivalent to Hajj or (indicative of uncertainty on the part of the Hadith narrator) equivalent to Hajj performed with the Prophet (peace be upon him). Then, comes the ‘Umrah in Dhul-Qa‘dah, for all the ‘Umrahs which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed took place in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>  Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow</p>

<p>A: It is permissible for a woman to take a medicine to delay her menstrual period, so that she can perform Hajj or ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), or observe Sawm in Ramadan, provided that it will result in no harmful effect on her. You do not have to make up for these days in which menstrual bleeding was stopped by the effect of the pills and you observed Sawm with the people.</p>

<p><strong>Q How to spend Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) in worship; is it by offering Salah (Prayer), reciting the Qur’an, reading the Sirah (the Prophet’s biography),listening to lectures and lessons, or celebrating it in the Masjid (Mosque)?</strong></p>

<p> First: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to be exceptionally diligent in his worship during the last ten days of Ramadan, more so than at any other time; praying, reciting the Qur’an and supplicating. It was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased upon her) that</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>when the last ten (nights of Ramadan) began, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would stay up the night, wake his family (for prayer) and tighten his Izar (i.e. exert himself in worship and abstain from conjugal intercourse). </p>
	<footer>Al-Bukhari and Muslim</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahmad and Muslim reported:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to strive hard in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan as he never did at any other time.

</blockquote>

<p>
Second: The Prophet (peace be upon him) exhorted to stay up and pray Qiyam (optional Night Prayer) on Laylat-ul-Qadr out of faith and in the hope of reward. It was narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		  Anyone who spends Laylat-ul-Qadr in Qiyam, out of Iman (Faith) and Ihtisab (confident anticipation of Allah’s Reward), will have their past sins forgiven.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This Hadith indicates that it is prescribed to stay up and spend this night in Qiyam.
</p>

<p>Third: One of the best Du‘a’s (supplications) to be said on Laylat-ul-Qadr is that which the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught to `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). It was reported by Al-Tirmidhy who ranked the Hadith as Sahih (authentic), that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, if I know which night is Laylat-ul-Qadr, what should I say on that night?' He replied, 'Say: Allahumma innaka ‘afuwwun tuhib-ul-‘afwa fa‘ffu ‘anny [O Allah! You are All-Forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me].'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fourth: With regard to specifying which night of Ramadan is Laylat-ul-Qadr; this requires specific evidence, however the odd-numbered nights during the last ten nights are more likely than others. The night of the twenty-seventh is the most likely to be Laylat-ul-Qadr based upon the Hadiths reported in this regard.</p>

<p>Fifth: With regard to Bid‘ahs (innovations in religion), they are not permissible during Ramadan or at other time. It was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated: </p>

<p><strong>Q: During the first twenty days of Ramadan, we are used to offering eleven Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer) of Tarawih (special supererogatory night Prayer in Ramadan). In the last ten days, we offer ten Rak‘ahs at the beginning of the night and ten Rak‘ahs at the end of it, then we pray three units of Witr, so that the total becomes twenty-three Rak‘ahs. A knowledge seeker claimed that differentiation in the number of Rak‘ahs between the first twenty days and the last ten days is a Bid‘ah (innovation in religion), and that the original ruling is complete equality in their number in all days throughout the whole month. He claimed that if we want to offer eleven Rak‘ahs at the beginning of the month, we should do the same at its end. If we want to offer twenty-three Rak‘ahs in the end of the month, we should do the same at the beginning. He also claimed that it is a Bid‘ah to differentiate between Salah (Prayer) in the beginning and the end of the night in the last ten days, as we offer ten short Rak‘ahs in the beginning of the night and call them Tarawih, and ten long Rak‘ahs at the end of the night and call them Qiyam-ul-Layl (optional Night Prayer). Please advise, may Allah benefit people by your knowledge and raise your rank.</strong></p>

<p>A: Tarawih Prayer offered in Ramadan is a stressed Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) performed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) who led his Sahabah (Companions) in offering it for many nights, and then he discontinued it lest that it should become obligatory on them. His Sahabah did it after his death (peace be upon him), and it is still offered to the present day. As for the number of its Rak‘ahs, there is no fixed authentic number. Some people claim that it is twenty-three; others claim that it is thirty-six; others claim more; and others claim less. During the era of `Umar the Sahabah used to offer twenty-three Rak‘ahs in the Prophet’s Mosque The Prophet (peace be upon him) never used to offer more than eleven or thirteen Rak‘ahs, whether in Ramadan or at any other time. He (peace be upon him) did not fix a certain number of Rak‘ahs for the people in Tarawih and Qiyam-ul-Layl; he (peace be upon him) used to exhort them to perform Qiyam-ul-Layl, especially in Ramadan, saying, </p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Anyone who spends Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) in Qiyam, out of Iman (Faith) and Ihtisab (confident anticipation of Allah’s Reward), will have their past sins forgiven.</p>
	<footer>Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on Tarawih Prayer, no. 2009; Muslim, Sahih, Book on travelers' Salah and Salah shortening no. 759; Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on fasting, no. 808; Al-Nasa'y, Sunan, Book on faith and its laws, no. 5027; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 1371; Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 529; Malik, Al-Muwatta', Book on call to Prayer, no. 251; Al-Darimy, Sunan, Book on fasting, no. 1776.</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>He (peace be upon him) did not fix a certain number of Rak‘ahs. This depends on the way a person offers Salah (Prayer); those who offer long Rak‘ahs can offer a small number of Rak‘ahs like what the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to do, while those who offer short Rak‘ahs out of mercy on people can offer a large number of Rak‘ahs like what the Sahabah used to do during the era of ‘Umar. There is nothing wrong in increasing the number of Rak‘ahs in the last ten days of Ramadan in comparison to the first twenty days, and dividing them into two parts: one that is offered in the beginning of the night in the form of short Rak‘ahs for Tarawih, and another that is offered in the end of the night in the form of long Rak‘ahs for Tahajjud (optional late night Prayer). The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to exert himself more in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan than any other time. When the last ten days of Ramadan began, he (peace be upon him) used to gird himself for the purpose, stay up the night, devote himself to worship with abstention from conjugal intercourse, and wake his family up to seek to attain Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree).A person who forbids increasing the number of Rak‘ahs at the end of the month than its beginning contradicts the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Salaf (righteous predecessors). We should follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and urge the people to follow it, not spread claims that decrease their interest in devoting themselves to worship in Ramadan.</p>

<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p><trong>Q 4: What are the conditions of I‘tikaf (seclusion for worship in a Masjid)? Is Sawm (Fasting) a condition of I‘tikaf? Is it permissible for a Mu‘takif (one who observes I‘tikaf) to visit a sick person, accept an invitation, tend to his family’s needs, attend a funeral, or go to work?</trong>
</p>

<p>A: It is prescribed to observe I‘tikaf in a Masjid (Mosque) in which congregational prayers are held. If the Mu‘takif is one of those for whom Jumu‘ah (Friday) Prayer is obligatory and the period of his I‘tikaf will include a Friday, it is better for him to stay in a Masjid where Jumu‘ah Prayer is observed. It is not a condition for the Mu‘takif to be fasting. According to the Sunnah (acts, sayings or approvals of the Prophet), the Mu‘takif should not visit the sick during his I‘tikaf, accept any invitation,tend to his family’s needs, attend any funeral, or go to work outside the Masjid, because it was authentically reported that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sunnah for the Mu‘takif is not to visit a patient, attend a funeral, touch or be intimate with his wife, or go out for anything unless it is an absolute must.</p>

<p><strong>Q 2: I am a senior student in one of the Egyptian universities. Usually students are overburdened with studies during Ramadan, since the final exams are immediately after that month.We have lots of studying to do during Ramadan and this deprives us from doing as much good deeds as we can, as we are commanded to. We wish to always recite the Qur’an and finish a Khatmah (one complete reading of the whole Qur’an) during the Tarawih (special supererogatory night Prayer in Ramadan). However, we pray in a nearby Masjid (mosque) where the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) recites short Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) and finishes prayer early. Deep inside, I wish the Imam could complete the recitation of the whole Qur’an during the Tarawih like in other Masjids, yet, again, there is not much time to study. Please answer me and may Allah benefit you! Will I bear a sin for that? Note that I offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers at their due times and fast perfectly.</strong></p>

<p>A: Tarawih Prayer is a stressed Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and it is necessary to feel calm and tranquil while performing its recitation, standing, bowing, prostration and the rest of its Rukn (integral parts). It is not Wajib (obligatory) to complete one reading of the whole Qur’an during Tarawih.</p>

<p><strong>Q 5: Is it an authentic Hadith that says: “The Sawm (Fasting) of Ramadan is not raised (to Allah) until Zakat-ul-Fitr (obligatory charity paid before the Festival of Breaking the Fast) is paid”? Is Zakat-ul-Fitr obligatory on a fasting Muslim who is needy and does not have the Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) based on the authenticity of the previous Hadith or other Islamic textual evidence authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him)?</strong></p>

<p>A: Zakat-ul-Fitr is obligatory on every Muslim who should be self-supporting if he has one Sa‘ (1 Sa‘ = 2.172 kg) or more in excess of his and his family’s need on the day and night of ‘Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast). This is based on the Hadith authentically reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) enjoined the payment of one Sa‘ of dates or one Sa‘ of barley as Zakat-ul-Fitr on every Muslim slave or free, male or female, young or old, and he ordered that it be paid before the people go out to offer ‘Eid Prayer.</p>

<footer>Related by Malik, Al-Muwatta', vol. 1, p. 284; Ahmad, vol. 2, pp. 5, 55, 63, 66, 102, 114, and 137; Al-Bukhari, vol. 2, pp. 138-140; Muslim, vol. 2, pp. 677-678, no. 984; Abu Dawud, vol. 2, pp. 263-265, nos. 1611 and 1612; Al-Tirmidhy, vol. 3, p. 61, nos. 675 and 676; Al-Nasa'y, vol. 5, pp. 47-49, nos. 2500-2505; Ibn Majah, vol. 1, p. 584, nos. 1825 and 1826; Al-Darimy, vol. 1, p. 392; Al-Daraqutny, vol. 2, pp. 139-141, no. 143; Ibn Hibban, vol. 8, pp. 94-97, nos. 3300-3304; Ibn Khuzaymah, vol. 2, pp. 80-84 and 87, nos. 2392, 2393, 2395, 2397, 2399, 2403, and 2411; Ibn Abu Shaybah, vol. 3, p. 172; Ibn Al-Jarud, vol. 2, p. 19, no. 356; and Al-Bayhaqy, vol. 4, pp. 162-166.</footer>

</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) is reported to have said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		We used to pay Zakat-ul-Fitr as one Sa‘ of food, or one Sa‘ of dried dates, or one Sa‘ of barley, or one Sa‘ of raisins, or one Sa‘ of curd during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him
	</p>

	<footer>(Related by both Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>It will also suffice to discharge the obligation by giving a Sa‘ of the local staple food such as rice and the like. Sa‘ here means the Sa‘ of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which is four handfuls scooped up with the two hands of an average built man. Accordingly, a person who does not pay Zakat-ul-Fitr is sinful and has to make up for it. With regard to the Hadith you have mentioned, we know nothing to the effect of its authenticity.</p>

<p>We ask Allah to guide you and to make our words and deeds and yours righteous.</p>

<p><strong>Q 3: In marketplaces, some men, whose religious commitment is unknown to us, ask us for Zakat-ul-Fitr (obligatory charity paid before the Festival of Breaking the Fast). There are others with a reasonable standard of living who spend whatever Zakah (obligatory charity) they receive on their children. There are others who receive a monthly salary, but are not very religious. Can Zakah be paid to these categories?</strong></p>

<p>A: Zakat-ul-Fitr should be paid to poor Muslims even if they are sinners as long as their sins are not so grave that they may drive them out of the fold of Islam. A poor person who deserves Zakat-ul-Fitr is the one whose apparent status indicates so, even if they are actually rich. However, the person paying Zakat-ul-Fitr should seek out good poor people as much as possible. If it turns out later that the person who took it is actually rich, it will not affect the payer of Zakah; rather, it will serve to discharge the obligation on their part, praise be to Allah.</p>

<p><strong>Q: A citizen called Khuwaylid Al-Jada`y Al-Matiry submitted the following question: On the eve of the thirtieth of Sha‘ban this year, he was in Kuwait when the radio of Kuwait announced their confirmed sighting of the crescent moon of Ramadan on Tuesday night which, according to the calendar of Um Al-Qura, would fall on the thirtieth of Sha‘ban. Shortly after he heard on the radio the announcement broadcasted on the radio of Riyadh on the authority of the Higher Judiciary Council that the crescent moon of Ramadan was not sighted by them on the Tuesday night corresponding to the thirtieth of Sha‘ban according to the calendar of Um Al-Qura. Accordingly, he, as well as the people of the country where he was present during the sighting of the crescent observed Sawm. After a couple of days, he came back to Saudi Arabia where Ramadan had begun one day later and the people had been fasting for two days, whereas he had been fasting for three. This may cause a problem for him at the end of the month if Ramadan completes thirty days.Is he obliged to fast with the people in Saudi Arabia or to stop fasting when Kuwait announces on the thirtieth of Ramadan that sighting the crescent of Shawwal is confirmed? The questioner thinks that the moon sighting announced on the radio of Riyadh is more correct and says that he fasted with the people of Kuwait only out of appreciating the sanctity of time. Please clarify this matter.</strong></p>

<p>A: If a person finds himself in a country where people have already started fasting, he must fast with them, because under such a situation the person present in another country will come under the same ruling as its own citizens. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Sawm (Fasting, i.e. beginning of Ramadan) is the day when you fast; Fitr (Breaking the Fast, i.e. end of Ramadan) is the day when you end the fast, and Al-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) is the day when you sacrifice.</p>

	<footer>Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on fasting, no. 697; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on fasting, no. 2324; and Ibn Majah, Sunan, Book on fasting, no. 1660.</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposing that he moved from a country where he has begun fasting with the people there, and went to another country, he should break or continue his Sawm according to the ruling of the people in the country to which he traveled, even if they end their Sawm earlier than the country where he has started fasting. But if he ends up fasting less than twenty-nine days, he must make up for one day (of fasting) later on, because the Hijri (lunar) month cannot be less than twenty-nine days.</p>
